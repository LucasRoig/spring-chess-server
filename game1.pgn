{Learning objectives: 1. This example reinforces the idea that having an
isolani in the endgame is a big problem. 2. Black can use the weakness of the
isolani to force the creation of new queenside weaknesses.} 1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {

difficulty in this position is his lack of material denies him hope of
counterplay.} 28. b4 {This move is necessary sooner or later in order to
prevent ...c6-c5} ({If White does not play b2-b4, then after} 28. Kh2 Qd8 29.

all.}) 28... Qd8 29. a3 h5 {Black improves his position as much as possible
before going for decisive action.} 30. Qf4 g6 31. Qe5 Rd5 32. Qe4 Kg7 {Black
brings his king closer to the centre, preparing himself for a rook endgame.}
33. Kg1 a5 $1 {A typical break. Now that everything is ready, Black creates a
new target in White’s camp. White must choose between having a weak pawn on
b4, or allowing ...c6-c5.} 34. Kh1 $6 {Making things easier for Black, though
the alternatives were not objectively better.} ({More stubborn was:} 34. bxa5 {
But Black has good winning chances after:} c5 $1 (34... Qxa5 {White has better
prospects after} 35. Rd3 Qd8 {threatening ...c6-c5, and now} 36. Rb3 $1 b5 37.

lines as they are extremely long and quite irrelevant.}) 35... Qd7 {Slowly

Although White’s defence is very difficult to say the least.}) 34... axb4 35.

technique.}) 38. Qa2 Kg8 39. Qa8+ Qf8 $6 {Black heads into a favourable rook
endgame, but misses a stronger option.} (39... Kg7 40. Qa1 f6 {would transpose

great defensive resource in} 45. Rc1+ $1 Kxb4 46. h4 {The game is far from
over, for example} Ka5 $5 47. Ra1+ Kb6 48. Ra8 Rd5 $17 {White has a difficult

capture Black’s kingside pawns}) 46. Kf4 Rxb4 47. Rc1+ Kxd4 $18 {The rest is
easy but instructive.} 48. Rd1+ Kc3+ 49. Kg5 Rd4 50. Rb1 Rd6 $1 {This prevents
any counterplay associated with Kxg6, and wins the game nicely.} 51. Rb6 (51.

Rc1 g5 62. Kd2 Kf4 63. Rf1+ Kxg4 64. Kc1 Rc5 {White cannot prevent the
promotion of the g-pawn.  1. The standard plan ...Qd8 and ...Rd5 forces White
to play b2-b4, in order to prevent ...c6-c5 winning a pawn. 2. Once b2-b4 had
been played, the break ...a7-a5 forces the creation of a weak b4-pawn, or
allows Black to finally achieve ...c6-c5. 3. The initial position looks like
just a very slight advantage for Black, but in fact White lost the game almost
without making a further mistake. 4. It should be noted that this version of
the isolani is slightly different from previous examples, as Black had a pawn
on the c-file, rather than the e-file.} 0-1
